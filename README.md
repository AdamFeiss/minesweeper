A twist on the famous game minesweeper, but you are an alcoholic soviet in some country after some war and your job is now to dispose of any left over explosives that have been left around your village. Don't let your hands shake too much.

Main Gameplay aspects:
Simple "simulator gameplay loop":
    - Every day you go out on the map (fields, forest, abandoned trenches, blow up tanks etc.)
    - Find and disarm left over munitions (Main Objekcive)
    - Destroying or disarming are both an option, while destroying is very save and simple, disarming will lead to a higher reward (Risk and Reward Factor)
    - Return home and collect the cash of the days work
    - Spend money on daily costs (urgency) or upgrades (vanity)
    - Restart Day
    - Unlock new tools to disarm stuff more efficiently (Character Progression)
    - Slowly but surely progress from disarming simple mines, to anti tank mines, left over bombs and more cool stuff TM (Challenge Progression)
    - Become rich and dont kill yourself (Optional)

Locations:
    - Village:
        - The junk yard:
            - Start your daily "mission" and accept additional quests for extra cash
            - Return at end of the day to turn in those special quests
            - Buy new equipment and upgrade your current one
            - Character: The instructor (name tbd)
        
        - The Supermarket:
            - Buy things for your daily expenses
            - Find love?
        
        - Your House:
            - Sleep here to pass the night
            - Upgrade your house to make it look nicer

    - The fields:
        - Here the main part of the game happends. A mixture of forest, fields and what ever else you find in a war torn country.
        - Localize mines by spotting them by eye, it can sometimes be a bit tricky, when they are more well hidden and not just spread around.
        - Failing to spot a mine and walking over it or not beeing careful enough while disarming it will result in a gameover screen, which will set you back to the last morning.
        - The map is persistent between runs, mines that you have already cleared will stay cleared, so you can slowly but steadily work your way into areas of interest. Not every playthrough will be the same, as the mines themselves are semi randomly placed from playthrough to playthrough. Certain big objectives will remain in the same spot though.
        - Here is a list of possible munitions you can find:
            - Explosive Anti-Personell Mines
                - Type 1: Pressure Activated (Activated by something falling or stepping on it)
                    - Can be disarmed by letting something fall ontop of it, shooting it or performing the disarm action: Picking up and opening up the mine and removing the activation pin
                    - Sometimes can be burried in the ground and will have to be carefully dugout with a shovel to enable the disarm action
                - Type 2: Wire activated
                    - Steel wires connected to the mine that trigger an explosion when pulled on. Can be disarmed by either destroying the mine itself by activating it or cutting the wire and then performing the "disarm action"
            - Claymores
                - Similar to the wire activated Explosive mines, the claymore can be more safely disarmed, since its directional steel ball explosion.
                - Because of the high range of these steel balls, the mine can sometimes be positioned rather far away from its booby-trap tripwire.
            - Unexploded ordanances
                - Explosive weapons that have either been not fired or missfired and therefore didnt explode. These explosive are easier to approach, as they dont have an booby-trap attached to them, Disarming is not alot easier thought, as they explosive payload they carry is a lot greater and their lethality range a lot higher. The issue with these is, determining if they have been fired and therefore are primed and ready to explode, or are just lying around dormant and inactive. Sometimes the munition isnt explosive at all, so the player has to distinguish the harmless but valuable munitions from the deadly onces.
                Types:
                - Mortal Shells
                    - Always explosive, Can be primed or unprimed, circumstancial evidence must lead the play to the right decision (In storage, fire/impact marks etc.)
                - Tank Shells
                    - Can be Armour Piercing (Harmless), High Explosive (Dangerous) or maybe even Depleted Uranium (Dangerous because of radiation maybe?), always primed but impossible to trigger for a person
                - Missiles
                    - WIP
                - Air to Surface Bombs
                    - Can be Primed or unprimed, are extremly rare and can be explosive, thermobaric or maybe even nuclear?

            Additionally you can find left over Guns, Ammo, Grenades and other weapons that you can sell for cash. These are entirely harmles (most of the time) but are often placed in a way that forces the player to disarm explosives around the stash, as to not to destroy them.

        - You can also find a special npc inside of a bunker, a left over soldier who believes the war is not over. He sends you on small fetch quests for more strange and rare items. Helping him out might prove usefull in the future.

        There is a main story line which can be advanced by reaching certain places of interest by slowly sweeping the map of explosives. It is not required to clear 100% of the map, but a completionist might do so.
        Areas are assigned a general tier, which will determine the intensity and complexity of explosives scattered around.

        Special quest items are placed on the map after the quest has been accepted, but they can be destroyed by inpropper handling of explosives. When this happens, the quest item will be respawned the next day in one of its other locations.

    - Equipment:
        There are multiple types of equipment, all of which have their specific purpose. The key identifier are the respective daily costs and carrying capacity associated with the equipment.
        When permanently upgrading equipment, the "old" versions of that tool remain available to the player

        1. The Rock
            - The player carries and infinite amount of rocks on him, always. It does not have to be reloaded and can be thrown to trigger munition activation mechanism.
            - Even higher tier explosives can be triggered by one or sometimes more precise rock throws.
            - The rock can not be used to disarm an explosive, only to destroy.
            - Since its low range the rock can sometimes be more danger then use, if especially unlucky the rock can be launched back at you after triggering the explosive
            - This weapon can also not be upgraded
        
        2. The spade
            - Some explosives are dug in too deeply into the ground to efficiently disarm/destroy. Using the spade on the ground around them can move them in a more favorable position.
            - Spade can also be used to hit destroyable objects like a crude axe or hammer. It is not always recommened to use this on explosives though.
            - Upgrading the spade increases its versatility and slowly transforms your trust spade into a set of tools ranging from an axe to a sledgehammer and a blow torch /metal saw
                - Axe allows the efficient breaking of wood
                - Hammer allows the breaking of concrete walls
                - Metal saw allows the opening of steel or plate surfaces
        
        3. The gun
            - Starting out with a handgun, the gun can be used to trigger explosives from a distance, essentially beeing a more secure form of the rock. Its uses are limited as only a certain amount of ammo can be carried into the forest.
            - When upgraded the handgun first gets upgraded to a shotgun, then a rifle with scope, and then something else idk what yet
                - The shotgun allows to be more sloppy with aim, as it has a larger aoe cone
                - The rifle excells at long distance difusal, requires more skill to use though
                - WIP
        
        4. The explosvies
            - The explosive category are a row of more intrecate contraptions to destroy. The first tier is the explosive handgrenade, throwing it near some explosives triggers their mechanisms and disarms them without line of sight always beeing necesarry.
            - The second tier, allows for remote controlled detonation: Duct tape and a long wire combined with the grenade makes it a primitive but effective remote explosive.
            - Unlocking c4 first allows the possiblity of timed explosions. Later on, the usage 2 disposable cell phones allows for true remote controlled explosives.
            - The last tier will be the pinacle of bomb diffusal: The Surface to Surface guided rocket launcher. Placing a tracking beacon at the target and firing the rocket from a save distance allows even the thoughest of bombs to be cracked.

        These where all the destructive tools at the players disposal: Now, to the disarming.

        5. Disarming Kit:
            - First: Your Hands. Some explosives often only require a bit of rotational force to open up and reveal the primer, which can be swiftly removed, rendering the payload harmless.
            - Wirecutters later can be used to disable simple wire based booby-traps
            - The Screwdriver Set is necessary to disarm more complexly built munitions.
            - WIP

        6. Detection tools:
            - Flashlight: Usefull in dark places
            - Binoculars: helpful for looking at things far away
            - Metal detector: Detects metal in a small cone infront of you.
            - Electro Magnetic Scanner (EM-Scanner): A shockwave in an area that shows weak electro magnetic reflections from metal objects
            - Multi Sensor Drone: Super lategame, allows you to buy a "scan" of a map location and uses multiple sensors and ai to reveal the locations of explosives on a map (only usefull for completionists)
